# SimpleForum
Very Simple Forum, made in PHP. Made in two hours, perfectioned in one week.

## Requirements:
- **PHP**: Version 7.4 or higher is recommended
- **Storage**: 256 MB is enough. May need more depending on how many posts are made.
- **RAM**: 1 GB should be enough.
- **Bandwidth**: Again, it depends on how many requests are made. This site is very light, 2 GB could be enough, considering there will be many posts.
